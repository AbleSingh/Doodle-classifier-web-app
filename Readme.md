With the world's expanding industrialization and the quick growth and expansion of the graphic arts sectors, People are spending more time seeking for apps with better-looking and easier-to-understand graphics, and one of the most essential aspects of this is their app selection. While Python is one of the most advanced and scientific programming languages, it suffers from a severe lack of a good graphical user interface and older libraries like tkinter can no longer meet the requirements of a modern user. For this purpose, the need of a new technology arises which is able to cater the new needs of modern GUI while significantly increasing the ease of using a python application. PyWorld is developed for this sole purpose only, the users of PyWorld   have access to best Python Applications at the click of their mouse with a great view and simple interface specially designed to dealing with most basic Python Apps and Complex ML systems, lessen the amount of difficulty disparity.

Basic Application – Weather App. This app is a very beginner friendly software that is written in Python and uses a Realtime database to retrieve weather information for the city provided in the app and show it to the user. Rather of creating a simple calculator app, weather app was a good choice since it shows the use of real time data and is somewhat useful for people 
Intermediate Application – Screen Recorder. This is another app written in python that can record the current screen by taking its height and width as parameters and then clicking images at specified frame rates and then saving it as a video. It is one of my favorite apps since its market alternatives are extremely cost inefficient and free versions include tacky watermarks.
Advanced Application – Doodle Classifier. The inspiration of doodle classifier is Google’s own quickdraw app which can identify what the user has drawn on screen. Recently, when google released the complete dataset of quickdraw having millions of classified doodles that were drawn by real people on quickdraw, It was a fantastic chance to do the model training using Google Collab and then utilize it for personal purposes.  
All these apps and all other alternatives also have very limited functionality when using basic python engine through IDE and hence are rendered completely inaccessible for end user who does not run apps through IDEs. It is not a smart practice, even for those who can run such programs straight from code, and having a wonderful visual change has been proved to improve productivity to new levels.

PyWorld although has its initial objectives mentioned at the beginning of the project completed but has far more scope for improvement. As stated in the project's scope, the goal of the project is to accomplish something that is being done all over the globe by nearly everyone working on different apps that have or will have python backends. Given, the app is in its initial stage and owing to a scarcity of computing resources not full use of PyWorld and python could be tested, but as we get more people and more Hardware support, a lot of features can be added to this application that could not be added right now.
